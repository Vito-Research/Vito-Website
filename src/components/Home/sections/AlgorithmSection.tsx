          Vito uses an optimized version of an algorithm called NightSignal,
          developed by Standford University researchers, to detect infection
          prior to symptom onset.

          to detect higher than normal heartrate and respiration rate. Due to
          the low computational complexity of this approach, our algorithm is
          extremely efficient and easy to run on mobile devices. The study Vito
          is based off showed that by using this algorithm, researchers could
          detect 77% of COVID-19 cases at or before the point where symptoms
          were visible.

          In the future, we also plan to experiment with using neural networks
          to match or exceed the performance of our current algorithm. We may
          allow users to opt-in to contribute de-identified vitals data so we
          can continuously train the network and improve detection accuracy for
          all Vito users.
